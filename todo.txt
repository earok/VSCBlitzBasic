Slice Slice#, Y, Flags Slice#, Y, Width, Height, Flags, BitPlanes, Sprites, Colours, w1, w2 The Slice command is used to create a Blitz slice object. Slices are primarily of  use in Blitz mode, allowing you to create highly customized displays. In both forms of the Slice command, the Y parameter specifies the vertical pixel position of the top of the slice. A Y value of 44 will position slices at about the top of the display. In the first torm of the Slice command, Flags refers to the number of bitplanes in any bitmaps (the bitmap's depth) to be shown in the slice. This form of the Slice command will normally create a lo-res slice, however this may be changed to a hi-res slice by adding eight to the Flags parameter. For instance, a Flags value of tour will set up a lo-res, 4 bitplane (16 colour) slice, whereas a Flags value of ten will set up a hi- res, 2 bitplane (4 colour) slice. The width of a slice set up in this way will be 320 pixels for a lo-res slice, or 640 pixels for a hi-res slice. The height of a slice set up using this syntax will be 200 pixels on an NTSC Amiga, or 256 pixels on a PAL Amiga. The second form of the Slice command is far more versatile, albeit a little more complex. Width and Height allow you to use specific values for the slice's dimensions. These parameters are specified in pixel amounts. BitPlanes refers to the depth of any bitmaps you will be showing in this slice. Sprites refers to how many sprite channels should be available in this slice. Each slice may have up to eight sprite channels, allowing sprites to be 'multiplexed'. This is one way to overcome the Amiga's 'eight sprite limit'. It is recommended that the top-most slice be created with all 8 sprite channels, as this will prevent sprite flicker caused by unused sprites. Colours refers to how many colour palette entries should be available for this slice, and should not be greater than 32. Width1 and Width2 specify the width, in pixels, of any bitmaps to be shown in this slice. If a slice is set up to be a dual-playfield slice, Width1 refers to the width of the 'foreground' bitmap, and Width2 refers to the width of the 'background' bitmap. If a slice is NOT set up to be a dual-playfield slice, both Width1 and Width2 should be set to the same value. These parameters allow you to show bitmaps which are wider than the slice, introducing the ability to smooth scroll through large bitmaps. The Flags parameter has been lett to last because it is the most complex. Flags allows you control over many aspects of the slices appearance, and just what ettect the slice has. Here are some example settings for Flags: Flags Effect Max BitPlanes $ftf8 A Standard lo-res slice 6 $fft9  A Standard hi-res slice 4 $fita  A Lo-res, dual-playfield slice 6 $tfib  A Hi-res, dual-playfiled slice 4 $fffc  A HAM slice 6 WARNING - the next bit is definitely for the more advanced users out there! Knowledge of the following is NOT necessary to make good use of slices. Flags is actually a collection of individual bit-flags. The bit-flags control how the slices 'copper list' is created. Here is a list of the bitsnumbers and their effect: Bit# Effect 15 Create copper MOVE BPLCON0 14 Create copper MOVE BPLCON1 13 Create copper MOVE BPLCON2 12 Create copper MOVE DIWSTRT and MOVE DIWSTOP 10 Create copper MOVE DDFSTRT and MOVE DDFSTOP  8 Create copper MOVE BPL1MOD  7 Create copper MOVE BPL2MOD  4 Create a 2 line 'blank' above top of slice  3 Allow for smooth horizontal scrolling  2 HAM slice  1 Dual-playtield slice  0 Hi-res slice - default is lo-res Clever selection of these bits allows you to create 'minimal' slices which may only affect specific system registers. The BitPlanes parameter may also be modified to specify 'odd only' or 'even only' bitplanes. This is of use when using dual playfield displays, as it allowing you to create a mid display slice which may show a different foreground or background bitmap leaving the other intact. To specify creation of foreground bitplanes only, simply set bit 15 of the BitPlanes parameter. To specify creation of background bitplanes only, set bit 14 of the BitPlanes parameter ",

No to be quite serious I really do not have a clue how they cludeged up the Amiga chip set. When ECS was introduced suddenly all display fetching moved to the right. Now they seem to have done the same to sprites so it is near impossible to have them all going without limiting yourself to a seriously thin display. If you hack around with the system copperlists you'll find they actually change fetch modes as you scroll a viewport across the display and commodore say you should not use sprites anyway so as to be compatible with their new hardware which is rumoured to run WindowsNT, yipeee.

X specifies a character position across the bitmap, and is always rounded down to a multiple of an eighth. Y specifies a character position down the bitmap, and may be a fractional value. For example, a Y of 1.5 will set a cusor position one and a half characters down from the top of the bitmap. CursX When using BitMapOutput to render text to a bitmap, CursX may be used to find the horizontal character position at which the next character Printed will appear. CursX will reflect the cursor position of the bitmap specified in the most recently executed BitMapOutput statement. CursY When using BitMapOutput to render text to a bitmap, CursY may be used to find the vertical character position at which the next character Printed will appear. CursY will reflect the cursor position of the bitmap specified in the most recently executed BitMapOutput statement. BitMapInput BitMaplnput is a special command designed to allow you to use Edit$ and Edit in Blitz mode. To work properly, a BlitzKeys On must have been executed before BitMapInput.

If you have not yet read the description of the Queue command, it would be a good idea to do so before continuing here. The buffer related commands are very similar to the queue related commands - Buffer, BBlit, and UnBuffer, and are used in exactly the same way. Where buffers differ from queues, however, is in their ability to preserve background graphics. Whereas an UnQueue command normally trashes any background graphics, UnBuffer will politely restore whatever the BBlits may have overwritten. This is achieved by the BBlit command actually performing two bliss. The first blit transfers the area on the bitmap which the shape is about to cover to a temporary storage area - the second blit actually draws the shape onto the bitmap. When the time comes to UnBuffer all those BBlits, the temporary storage areas will be transferred back to the disrupted bitmap. The Memorylen parameter of the Buffer command refers to how much memory, in bytes, should be put aside as temporary storage for the preservation of background graphics. The value of this parameter varies depending upon the size of shapes to be BBlited, and the maximum number of shapes to be BBlited between UnBuffers. A Memorylen of 16384 should be plenty for most situations, but may need to be increased if you start getting 'Buffer Overflow' error messages. ",

Stencils allow you create the effect of shapes moving 'between' background and foreground graphics. Used properly, stencils can add a sense of 'depth' or 'three dimensionality' to animations. So what steps are involved in using stencils? To begin with, you need both a bitmap and a stencil object. A stencil object is similar to a bitmap in that it contains various graphics. Stencils differ, however, in that they contain no colour information. They simply determine where graphics are placed on the stencil. The graphics on a stencil usually correspond to the graphics representing 'foreground' scenery on a bitmap. So the first step is to set up a bitmap with both foreground and background scenery on it. Next, a stencil is set up with only the foreground scenery on it. This may be done using either the Stencil or SBlit command. Now, we BBlit our shapes. This will, of course, place all the shapes in front of both the background and the foreground graphics.

You can change the flags as often as you like, causing all of your windows to have their own set of IDCMP flags if you wish. A window's IDCMP flags will affect the types of 'events' reportable by the window. Events are reported to a program by means of either the WaitEvent or Event functions.

This should be sufficient for most programs. If you do use DefaultIDCMP for some reason, it is important to remember to include all flags necessary for the functioning of the program.

Proportional gadgets are commonly used for the 'R G B' sliders seen in many paint packages. Proportional gadgets have 2 main qualities - a 'pot' (short for potentiometer) setting, and a'body' setting. The pot setting refers to the current position of the slider bar, and is in the range 0 through 1. For example, a proportional gadget which has been moved to 'half way' would have a pot setting of '.5'. The body setting refers to the size of the units the proportional gadget represents, and is again in the range 0 through 1. Again taking the RGB colour sliders as an example, each slider is intended to show a particular value in the range 0 through 15 - giving a unit size, or body setting, of 1/16 or '.0625'. Put simply, the pot setting describes 'where' the slider bar is, while the body setting describes 'how big' it is. Proportional gadgets may be represented as either horizontal slider bars, vertical slider bars, or a combination of both. See the beginning of the chapter for relevant Flags settings for prop gadgets. X and Y refer to the gadgets position, relative to top left of the window it is opened in. Width and Height refer to the size of the area the slider should be allowed to move in. Id is a unique, non zero nr. which allows to identify when the gadget is manipulated.

This is a string as in \"this is a string\" and will vary depending on what you wish to do with ARexx. Normally this will be the name of an ARexx script file you wish to execute. ARexx will then look for the script by the name as well as the name with the exten added.(this is the exten you used when you created the RexxMsg structure using CreateRexxMsg()). This could also be a string file. That is a complete ARexx script in a single line. ActionCodes: the flag values you use to tell ARexx what you want it to do with the commandstring you have supplied.
