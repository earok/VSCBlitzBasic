Work-In-Progress Visual Studio Code language definition for Blitz Basic (Amiga)

Instructions:

Download or clone from https://github.com/earok/VSCBlitzBasic to "%USERPROFILE%\.vscode\extensions\VSCBlitzBasic" on Windows, "$HOME/.vscode/extensions/VSCBlitzBasic" on Mac/Linux

(Re)open visual studio

If it's in the right place, any .bb or .bb2 files should be highlighted, and it'll say Blitz Basic in the corner.
Make sure any files you create with it have "LF" line endings (again, in the corner, it's easy to switch between them)

This goes without saying, but you still need an Amiga environment to compile it. My standard setup is to load WinUAE, trigger a script that makes a copy of my code (that I can save on top of to keep the Blitz Basic settings, without tokenisation messing up the original) and opens it in Blitz Basic.
